# CsSpy

CsSpy is a Visual Studio Visualizer for instances of the Commerce Server [DictionaryClass](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb509189).  It was built for use in building the [Enticify](http://www.enticify.com/) Commerce Server Connector.

CsSpy is source only at the moment.  A release will be made soon.

CsSpy banishes the crappy COM interop debugging experience and shows you this instead:
